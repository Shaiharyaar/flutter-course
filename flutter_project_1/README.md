## 3 key challenges faced during the project

1. Handling complex data in SharedPreference and finding the optimal way to read and update it.
2. Creating test cases was by far the most challenging but fun part for me. Especially creating the mock ups for API calls.
3. Running multiple tests at the same with navigation involved.

## 3 key learning moments from working on the project

1. I learned how to persist data throughout the application even when when user turns off the application.
2. Combining SharedPreference with API in classes and handling pre-processing.
3. Writing test cases involving complex scenarios.
