# Device-Agnostic Design Course Project II - 139c502d-17da-49bb-bcaa-7c683af92b3c

# Application Name: Yumly

Yumly is a recipe app I built using Flutter and Firebase that works on both mobile and desktop. It lets users search for recipes by name, browse different recipe categories, and see detailed recipe information like ingredients and steps. Users can log in (anonymously if they want) to create, edit, and delete their own recipes. They can also mark recipes as favorites and view them on a special favorites page. The app is responsive, meaning it looks good and works well on all device sizes, and it features smooth navigation and an easy-to-use interface.

## 3 key challenges faced during the project

1. Making sure the app looked good and worked well on both phones and computers was tricky and needed a lot of testing.
2. Ensuring the navigation between different pages was intuitive and easy to use required careful design and testing.
3. Organizing the data structure in Firebase so that recipes, categories, and user information were stored and retrieved correctly was challenging.

## 3 key learning moments from working on the project

1. Understanding how to use Firebase for login and data storage taught me a lot about managing user information securely.
2. Figuring out how to efficiently load and display recipe data while keeping the app running smoothly was a valuable learning experience.
3. Developing a user-friendly interface taught me the importance of thoughtful design choices and intuitive navigation pathways.
